## Prerequisites

In order to launch the app, you must have [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed

## Server setup

Create a `.env` file containing your Google Maps API key following this format:
```env
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<your key>
```
if this key is not set or not valid, the app will run but you will not be able to load Google Maps

To start the app in development, first open a terminal then run this command:

```bash
cd phone_app ; flutter pub get ; flutter run
```

To build an APK ready for production, run this command in a terminal:

```
cd phone_app ; flutter pub get ; flutter build apk
```

Have fun with our app !
